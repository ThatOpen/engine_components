This library is a collection of BIM tools based on [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) and other libraries. It includes pre-made features to easily build browser-based 3D BIM applications, such as postproduction, dimensions, floorplan navigation, DXF export and much more.

## Packages

This library contains 2 packages:

`@thatopen/components` - The core functionality. Compatible both with browser and Node.js environments.

`@thatopen/components-front` - Features exclusive for browser environments.

## Usage

You need to be familiar with [Three.js API](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) to be able to use this library effectively. In the following example, we will create a cube in a 3D scene that can be navigated with the mouse or touch events. You can see the full example [here](https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_components/blob/main/packages/core/src/core/Worlds/example.ts) and the deployed app [here](https://thatopen.github.io/engine_components/examples/Worlds/index.html).

```js
/* eslint import/no-extraneous-dependencies: 0 */

import * as THREE from "three";
import * as OBC from "../..";

const container = document.getElementById("container")!;

const components = new OBC.Components();

const worlds = components.get(OBC.Worlds);

const world = worlds.create<
  OBC.SimpleScene,
  OBC.SimpleCamera,
  OBC.SimpleRenderer
>();

world.scene = new OBC.SimpleScene(components);
world.renderer = new OBC.SimpleRenderer(components, container);
world.camera = new OBC.SimpleCamera(components);

components.init();

const material = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: "#6528D7" });
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
world.scene.three.add(cube);

world.scene.setup();

world.camera.controls.setLookAt(3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0);
```
